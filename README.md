# Agent-based modelling of the information economy

This repo is being used to share code etc for agent-based modelling of the information economy using [Repast Simphony](http://repast.sourceforge.net/).

Please use the [issues](https://github.com/theodi/abm-information-economy/issues) here for comments, advice and suggestions - they will be most welcome!

## Running the code

1. Go through the [ReLogo Getting Started Guide](http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs/ReLogoGettingStarted.pdf) to get familiar with Repast Simphony

2. Create a new ReLogo project called `InformationEconomy`

3. Copy the contents of the [`repast-src`](https://github.com/theodi/abm-information-economy/tree/master/repast-src) directory from this repository into the `~/workspace/InformationEconomy/src` directory

4. Run the simulation!
